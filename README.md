Your (Claude Code|Codex|Cursor|Gemini|Opencode) powered (Linear|GitHub|GitLab|Slack) agent. Atmiko monitors (Linear|GitHub|GitLab|Slack) issues assigned to it, creates isolated Git worktrees for each issue, runs (Claude Code|Codex|Cursor|Gemini|Opencode) sessions to process them, and streams detailed agent activity updates back to (Linear|GitHub), along with rich interactions like dropdown selects and approvals.

**Note:** Atmiko is a BYOK platform (bring your keys / subscriptions) for tokens.

## Getting Started

### Self-Hosted Setup

Host everything yourself with your own Linear OAuth app, GitHub App, and Slack App. An AI-guided setup skill handles the entire onboarding: installing dependencies, configuring auth, creating integration apps, and connecting repositories — so you don't have to follow a manual guide.

```bash
npx skills add nexmoe/atmiko -g
```

Then in any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.):

```
/atmiko-setup
```

The skills install **Atmiko from source**, including `/board` and task history. `skills add` itself only downloads the setup skills; `/atmiko-setup` runs their bundled source installer. The runtime is built with the checkout's pinned pnpm version and frozen lockfile, with no dependency on a global `atmiko` installation.

### What to Expect

Running `/atmiko-setup` starts a guided conversation with your coding agent. It walks you through the following steps, checking existing configuration as it goes:

1. **Choose your agent's name and integrations.** Pick the services you want to use: Linear, GitHub, GitLab, or Slack. Setup only configures the integrations you select.
2. **Install Atmiko on your machine.** The agent checks prerequisites, helps you install missing tools, and downloads and builds Atmiko from source.
3. **Connect your coding credentials.** The default setup guides you through Claude Code authentication with your own API key, OAuth token, or supported provider account. Atmiko also supports other runners through its [configuration](./docs/CONFIG_FILE.md).
4. **Connect your chosen services.** Set up a public webhook URL using a tunnel or your own domain, then create and authorize the integration apps. The agent can help with browser steps or provide manual instructions; you sign in and approve access to your accounts.
5. **Add your repositories.** Choose the repositories Atmiko should work on. Setup clones them and saves Atmiko's settings under `~/.atmiko`.
6. **Start Atmiko and verify it works.** Review the setup summary, choose how to keep it running, and start the worker. The agent checks the local service and gives you the `/board` URL for tasks and logs.

**Try your first task:** assign a Linear issue to Atmiko, @mention it on a configured GitHub PR or GitLab MR, or mention the bot in Slack. It creates an isolated workspace for the task, runs the coding agent, and sends progress and results back to the connected service. Keep Atmiko and your webhook tunnel running so new tasks can reach it.

You can run `/atmiko-setup` again to add integrations or update your configuration.

See **[Fork Installation](./docs/FORK_INSTALLATION.md)** for requirements, the verified launcher, updates and source commit verification. The existing npm version number alone does not identify a fork build.

Or follow the **[manual setup guide](./docs/SELF_HOSTING.md)** if you prefer.
