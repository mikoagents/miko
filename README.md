Miko is a self-hosted development agent for Linear, GitHub, GitLab, Slack, and Zulip. It works on tasks in isolated Git worktrees and sends progress and results back to your team. Choose Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, OpenCode, or Grok as the coding engine.

Use your own API keys or coding-agent subscriptions.

## Getting Started

### Self-Hosted Setup

Host everything yourself with your own Linear OAuth app, GitHub App, and Slack App. An AI-guided setup skill handles the entire onboarding: installing dependencies, configuring auth, creating integration apps, and connecting repositories — so you don't have to follow a manual guide.

```bash
npx skills add mikoagents/miko -g
```

Then in any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.):

```
/miko-setup
```

The skills install **Miko from source**, including `/board` and task history. `skills add` itself only downloads the setup skills; `/miko-setup` runs their bundled source installer. The runtime is built with the checkout's pinned pnpm version and frozen lockfile, with no dependency on a global `miko` installation.

### What to Expect

Running `/miko-setup` starts a guided conversation with your coding agent. It walks you through the following steps, checking existing configuration as it goes:

1. **Choose your agent's name and integrations.** Pick the services you want to use: Linear, GitHub, GitLab, or Slack. Setup only configures the integrations you select.
2. **Install Miko on your machine.** The agent checks prerequisites, helps you install missing tools, and downloads and builds Miko from source.
3. **Connect your coding credentials.** The default setup guides you through Claude Code authentication with your own API key, OAuth token, or supported provider account. Miko also supports other runners through its [configuration](./docs/CONFIG_FILE.md).
4. **Connect your chosen services.** Set up a public webhook URL using a tunnel or your own domain, then create and authorize the integration apps. The agent can help with browser steps or provide manual instructions; you sign in and approve access to your accounts.
5. **Add your repositories.** Choose the repositories Miko should work on. Setup clones them and saves Miko's settings under `~/.miko`.
6. **Start Miko and verify it works.** Review the setup summary, choose how to keep it running, and start the worker. The agent checks the local service and gives you the `/board` URL for tasks and logs.

**Try your first task:** assign a Linear issue to Miko, @mention it on a configured GitHub Issue/PR or GitLab MR, or mention the bot in Slack. It creates an isolated workspace for the task, runs the coding agent, and sends progress and results back to the connected service. Keep Miko running, along with any tunnel you use, so new tasks can reach it.

You can run `/miko-setup` again to add integrations or update your configuration.

New source installations automatically follow `main`: Miko checks in the background, builds updates while the current version keeps running, and restarts only when tasks are idle. A failed startup rolls back automatically. Unmodified default skills update with the runtime; your customized skills are preserved. Existing installations need one upgrade to receive this update mechanism. See [update controls and recovery](./docs/FORK_INSTALLATION.md#automatic-updates).

See **[Fork Installation](./docs/FORK_INSTALLATION.md)** for requirements, the verified launcher, updates and source commit verification. The existing npm version number alone does not identify a fork build.

Or follow the **[manual setup guide](./docs/SELF_HOSTING.md)** if you prefer.
