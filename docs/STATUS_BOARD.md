# Local status board

Start Atmiko normally, then open [http://127.0.0.1:3456/board](http://127.0.0.1:3456/board).
The board starts and stops with the same application server as `/status` and the webhook endpoints.
Use your configured server port if it differs from 3456. No second server, command, or port is needed.

For this fork, follow [Fork Installation](./FORK_INSTALLATION.md) and start it with the verified source launcher. Downloading the setup skills alone does not install the runtime; run `/atmiko-setup` to build it.

The English interface has a task list and a live log pane. The default **Activity** view shows
compact, color-coded assistant, tool, result and Atmiko rows. Tool calls and results appear together
when explicit IDs identify the same call within the same task and runner session. Older records
without correlation IDs keep separate result rows. Click a row to expand its recorded input/output.
Click the arrow beside a task's issue identifier to open that issue in Linear in a new tab.
This also works for archived tasks and leaves the current log selection unchanged. Tasks without
a Linear-style issue identifier have no external link. Links use Linear's documented
[`/issue/ENG-123` route](https://linear.app/docs/get-the-app) and your signed-in Linear account.
Each task also shows its recorded model beside its repository. Tasks with no saved model,
including older archives, display **Model unknown**; the board does not infer a model from current defaults.
The disclosure arrow uses a bundled [Hugeicons](https://github.com/hugeicons/hugeicons) SVG,
centered in the row and rotated around its center when expanded; it requires no external request.
Search matches the full loaded text, including collapsed results; **Errors only** retains the call
beside its failed result. **Wrap details** controls expanded and raw text.

The log pane uses one compact toolbar with view switching, search and selection controls.
The **Log options** (`⋯`) menu contains source/error filters, wrapping, Follow, pause, refresh,
loaded-window statistics and selected-task details. A dot on that menu indicates active filters
or paused updates. The status dot beside **Tasks** shows the service state on hover.
There is no breadcrumb: click the selected task again, or choose **Show all tasks** in Log options,
to return to the combined log stream.

Drag across log rows to draw a selection rectangle. Rows touched by the rectangle are selected;
hold Ctrl/Cmd or Shift while dragging to add to the selection. Dragging near the list's top or
bottom edge scrolls it automatically. Expanded detail text retains normal text selection.
Row checkboxes are also available; Shift-click selects a range and Ctrl/Cmd-click toggles a row.
The toolbar checkbox selects all currently visible rows.
Press **Esc** to clear row selection and cancel an active selection rectangle. This also resets
the Shift-selection anchor; when rows are selected, Esc preserves the current search text.
Choose **Copy** or press **Ctrl+C / Cmd+C** while the log pane has focus to copy the selection
in display order, with timestamps and full loaded text, including paired tool results.
Native text selections and search fields keep their normal copy behavior. Selection stops Follow,
survives live updates for retained rows, and clears when changing the task, filters or view.
If browser clipboard access fails, keep focus in the pane and use the keyboard copy shortcut.

The three-lane activity strip shows recorded event order. Click a marker to jump to its row.
Markers do not represent execution durations. **Span** measures the time between the first and
last loaded entries, including idle gaps; **Calls** and **Errors** count this loaded window, not
the task's lifetime totals. Search and error filters narrow the rows and strip together.

Switch to **Raw** for the bundled React LogViewer, including line numbers, previous/next match
navigation and matching-line filtering. Both views support pause and follow. Scrolling up,
searching, expanding a row or selecting a timeline marker disables Follow; enabling it returns
to the latest output. Source filters and task selection apply to both views.
When scrolled away from the bottom, a floating down-arrow button appears in the lower-right
corner. **Jump to bottom and follow new logs** returns to the latest output, clears text search
and enables Follow. Source/error filters and the selected task stay unchanged; paused updates
stay paused until resumed in Log options.
Task titles and log messages retain their original language.

## Data and status

- Running comes directly from each session's live runner. A process-wide busy status never makes an idle task appear running.
- The board includes issue sessions and chat sessions managed by this Atmiko instance.
- Agent logs include assistant text, tool calls, tool results, and completion/error results from the common runner message interface.
- Atmiko logs come from its structured logger, starting when the board is registered. Historical stdout/stderr files are not scanned.
- Saved assistant, tool, tool-result and completion entries are merged with live output, including after a restart or a resumed turn. Matching output is shown once, using its saved timestamp.
- Issue sessions are archived before terminal-state or age-based cleanup, even when no browser is open. Archived tasks remain in the list after restart and are labeled `Archived`; they never appear as running. If a session is resumed, its live record takes precedence.
- The archive is stored in `<atmikoHome>/state/board-history.json` with atomic writes. It keeps up to 200 removed tasks and the latest 100 public agent log entries per task, within 16 MiB overall; the oldest tasks are evicted first. Storage failures show a warning and do not stop Atmiko.
- Snapshots show up to 60 retained sessions, prioritizing running tasks, plus the archive. Live logs retain 650 recent entries. Individual entries are limited to 4,000 characters. Selecting an archived task loads its own logs, so new activity cannot displace them from the shared live log window.
- This archive starts when the updated worker is installed. Tasks already deleted before installation cannot be reconstructed automatically. Chat sessions are shown while retained by their chat handler; the removal archive follows the issue-session manager.
- Agent messages use the session update time for initial history and the time first observed by the board for new messages. These are observation times, not exact SDK event timestamps.

The page receives snapshots over `/board/events` every two seconds while it is open.
`/board/api/snapshot` supplies the same data as JSON. Closing the last page stops the streaming timer.
`/board/api/history/:sessionId` supplies an archived task's bounded log entries on demand.
The existing `/status` response remains unchanged.

## Local access

The board and its data endpoints accept direct loopback connections with a localhost/loopback Host header.
Remote connections, forwarded/proxied requests (including Cloudflare Tunnel), and foreign browser origins are rejected.
Webhook and OAuth endpoints keep their existing behavior. The board is read-only.

Only selected session fields and visible output are sent to the browser. User/system prompts,
reasoning blocks, runner/config objects, and workspace paths are not serialized as session metadata.
Common credential formats are redacted from text. Logs can still contain project content, so the board stays local.

## Development

The UI source is in `packages/edge-worker/board/`. Run `pnpm --filter atmiko-edge-worker build:board`
after editing it. The regular edge-worker build includes this step and packages the generated files under `dist/board/`.
React and React LogViewer are bundled locally; no CDN or extra frontend process is used at runtime.

The pinned React LogViewer 6.5.5 component has a small compatibility adapter for empty filtered results
and match navigation after filtering. Tests cover both cases. The dependency's original files remain unchanged.
Its pinned Immutable dependency is overridden to 5.1.9 to include the upstream security fixes;
remove that scoped override when React LogViewer updates its dependency.

React LogViewer source: https://github.com/melloware/react-logviewer (MPL-2.0).
Its license and bundled dependency notices are included with the generated assets.
