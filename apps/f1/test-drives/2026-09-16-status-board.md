# Test Drive: Integrated local status board

**Date:** 2026-09-16

**Goal:** Verify that the real EdgeWorker serves `/board` alongside `/status` and reports live runner activity without a separate monitor process.

**Environment:** Windows, Node 24.9.0, Bun 1.2.23; disposable F1 repository and port 3600. The existing production instance was left running.

## Verification results

### Issue tracker and EdgeWorker

- [x] Built the monorepo and initialized a fresh repository with the built F1 CLI.
- [x] Started `apps/f1/server.ts` with `ATMIKO_DEFAULT_RUNNER=codex` and `CODEX_MODEL=gpt-6-astra`.
- [x] F1 `ping` and `status` succeeded.
- [x] Created `DEF-2` with label `primary`; repository label routing selected the test repository.
- [x] Started `session-2`; Atmiko created its worktree and ran Codex.
- [x] The read-only task inspected README.md and returned the requested phrase, without changing files or creating a commit/PR.
- [x] `view-session --session-id session-2 --limit 3 --offset 1` returned three of six activities with timestamps and readable content.
- [x] Both test sessions stopped successfully, the disposable server was terminated, and the test repository remained clean.

The initial unlabeled issue correctly requested repository selection and never appeared as a running task. The second issue used the harness's documented routing label.

### Board data and rendering

- [x] `/board`, its bundled assets, and `/board/api/snapshot` are served by the same application server as `/status`.
- [x] During execution, the snapshot reported `service.status=busy`, task `status=running`, the selected repository and model, and assistant/tool/result output.
- [x] After completion, the same task reported `status=completed` while the service reported `idle`. The result contained “Board integration verified”. The CLI issue session remained active, confirming the board did not mistake persisted session status for runner activity.
- [x] Automated tests verify initial and subsequent SSE frames, stream shutdown, loopback restrictions on every board route, unchanged `/status`, output allowlisting, redaction, and live-runner prioritization.
- [x] React LogViewer adapter tests verify empty matching-line results and navigation using filtered row positions.
- [x] Package dry-run includes HTML, JS, CSS, dependency notices, and the React LogViewer license under `dist/board/`.
- [ ] Visual browser verification: Edge returned `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` for both localhost and 127.0.0.1 on the test port. Browser protections were left unchanged. HTTP and component checks passed, but this run does not claim a visual browser pass.

## Commands and results

Use `bun run apps/f1/dist/src/cli.js` for the built F1 CLI on Windows. Its source entry point resolves package.json relative to the compiled directory layout.

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm --filter atmiko-core test:run test/log-publisher.test.ts
pnpm --filter atmiko-edge-worker test:run test/StatusBoard.test.ts test/BoardViewer.test.ts
pnpm -r --no-bail --filter './packages/*' test:run
pnpm audit --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
```

- Full build and typecheck: pass.
- New tests: 15/15 pass.
- Changed source files: Biome check passes.
- Dependency audit: zero advisories. React LogViewer pins Immutable 5.1.5; a scoped override uses the patched 5.1.9 release.
- Full package suite: 125 failures on this Windows host. A separate checkout of unchanged base `e9e1e53` reproduces exactly the same 125 failing test names; no new failures. Examples include POSIX permission bits, slash-sensitive paths, and shell mocks.
- Full lint: the checkout has CRLF formatting failures and existing warnings. Baseline: 489 errors / 12 warnings; this branch: 482 errors / 12 warnings. Unrelated files were not reformatted.

## Retrospective

The existing server can provide a useful live view directly from its owned runners and structured logger. No process scanning, credentials/config serialization, standalone listener, or production restart was needed. Remaining validation limitations are the baseline Windows checks and the blocked Edge visual check described above.

## History regression follow-up

A resumed runner has a new message buffer even though the session manager still retains previous turns. The original board only read saved entries when there was no runner, so resuming a session hid its history. Two regression tests reproduced this omission and the loss of saved timestamps before the fix.

The board now merges saved public output with the runner buffer and suppresses overlapping entries by runner session ID, output kind and content, preserving occurrence counts and saved timestamps. Saved tool results are included; plain user prompts remain excluded. This also restores tool names in historical output.

Validation: all 17 board/logger tests pass; full build and typecheck pass. The worker suite has 807 passing tests, one skip, and the same 52 Windows failures present in the base commit, with no new failures. A local saved-state check confirmed that history remains visible even with an empty replacement runner. This fixes retained history visibility; it does not restore tasks previously deleted by session cleanup.

## Task archive follow-up

The left task list still lost completed issues because terminal-state cleanup removes both the session and its entries. A regression test reproduced the empty task list after `removeSession`, independently of whether the page had ever been opened.

The session manager now emits a removal event before deleting entries, including age-based cleanup. The board captures allowlisted task metadata and recent public output, then saves an atomic, bounded archive under the configured Atmiko home. Archived rows and per-task log retrieval survive restart; live sessions override an archive with the same ID. Archive errors do not interrupt task cleanup. Other runners retain their observed start times when a task is archived.

An additional F1 drive used a fresh disposable repository on port 3600 and a real Codex runner. The labeled issue `DEF-1` read README.md and returned `Archive lifecycle verified.` Six tracker activities were verified with pagination. `terminate-issue --issue-id issue-1 --action completed` then ran actual terminal cleanup. The first board request was made only after cleanup: it returned the task with `archived=true`, `status=completed`, and five archived agent entries including the final result. The repository remained clean and the test server was stopped.

Validation: 22 board/history/viewer/logger tests pass, including restart, ID deduplication, age-based cleanup, retention limits, redaction, corrupt/unwritable storage, and history-route access control. Full monorepo build and typecheck pass. The worker suite has 812 passing tests, one skip, and the same 52 baseline Windows failures; changed-file Biome checks pass.

The updated local service was also verified in the user's existing Edge tab: both a retained task and an archived task appeared, and selecting the archive loaded its individual log entries. This supersedes the earlier blocked browser check for the local installation. Historical data recovered for that installation was kept outside the repository; automatic recovery of tasks deleted before this archive existed is not claimed.

## Fork installer follow-up

The setup skills previously installed the official npm package, so changing only the skill repository could not reproduce this fork's board. The prerequisites skill now bundles a Node installer and launcher. The tested runtime pin is `11a7f23bf8c71c72409bd39477979623a1e175d5`; this is independent of the setup skills' own revision. Authentication, repository commands and service examples use the verified launcher.

Validation on Windows / Node 24.9.0:

- A fresh installation directory containing a space was populated by fetching the pinned commit from GitHub, installing its frozen lockfile using pnpm 10.33.1, and building the CLI dependency graph. No global Atmiko artifacts were copied into it.
- `--installation` reported the expected repository and commit, with worker/core resolving to the source workspace packages. The launcher passed through ordinary CLI options and `--version`.
- The launcher started an actual worker on isolated port 3600 with an empty, separate Atmiko home. `/status`, `/board` and `/board/api/snapshot` succeeded. A console interrupt ran normal state persistence and server shutdown. The production worker on 3456 was not restarted.
- Reinstalling the immutable pin reused the verified build. A real fetch of a nonexistent ref failed without changing `current.json`.
- Four Node tests passed: CLI argument forwarding, rejection of an in-tree published-package substitute, missing assets/path escapes, and preservation of the selected runtime on invalid input or concurrent installation. Five modified skills passed the skill validator; installer files passed Biome. Existing board/history/viewer tests remained 20/20 passing.
- After the launcher smoke test stopped, F1's additional development dependencies were installed in the disposable source release. A real Codex task read README.md and returned `Fresh fork verified.` Its six activities were checked with pagination. Terminal cleanup retained an archived completed task with five log entries and the final result. The test repository stayed clean.

The installer has explicit macOS/Linux execution paths, but this host only exercised Windows. It retains prior release directories and does not automatically migrate existing service commands; the launch skill performs that switch when the worker is idle.

The distribution path was also exercised with skills 1.5.26: installing `nexmoe/atmiko#feat/integrated-status-board` into a disposable project downloaded all five changed skills, including the installer, launcher and source pin. The downloaded installer verified the existing smoke installation successfully. The README uses this tested `#ref` syntax because a GitHub `/tree/` URL incorrectly split the slash-containing branch name.

## Compact activity UI follow-up

The default log view now uses single-line, color-coded activity rows with expandable details, paired tool input/results, error highlighting, full-text search and a three-lane event strip. The Raw view retains the bundled React LogViewer. Pairing requires an opaque ID derived from the runner session and tool call, plus the same Atmiko task; older unlinked archives remain readable as separate rows. Empty tool results are retained. Statistics describe only the loaded log window, and strip markers represent event order rather than execution duration.

A fresh disposable F1 repository on port 3600 ran a real Codex task that read README.md and returned `Activity pairing verified.` The tracker recorded six activities; pagination returned three entries at offset one. The board exposed two assistant entries, one tool call, one tool result and one completion entry. After terminal cleanup, the archived task was completed and its five entries projected into four rows with one correctly paired tool/result. The repository stayed clean and the idle test server was stopped.

Validation: full monorepo build and typecheck passed. All 26 worker board/history/viewer/activity tests passed. The full worker suite has 818 passing tests, one skip and exactly the same 52 failing test names as the established Windows baseline. Changed-file Biome checks passed. The existing two local tasks survived the production update, and public agent entries now include correlation IDs. The existing local webhook patch was preserved by hash.

Visual verification for this UI revision could not be completed: claiming the existing Edge tab timed out, and a fresh Edge tab reported `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` for the local URL. Browser protections were not changed. HTTP, build, data projection and real-runner validation passed; this follow-up does not claim a browser interaction or screenshot pass.

The setup pin was advanced to activity runtime commit b5df78c8aef9f1072f382df8c945f2be2d7d4ab6. The bundled installer fetched and built that revision in an isolated directory, and its board JavaScript hash matches the deployed local build. All four installer regression tests still pass.


## Multi-row copy follow-up

Activity rows now support checkbox selection, Shift ranges, Ctrl/Cmd-click toggling, selecting all visible rows, and copying with a button or Ctrl/Cmd+C. Copied text includes timestamps, full loaded text, and paired tool results in display order. Native text selection keeps standard clipboard behavior. Selection stops Follow, remains attached to retained rows during live updates, and clears when changing task, filters or view.

Three new regression tests cover individual/range selection, filtered ranges and expired anchors, and exact full-text serialization with paired results and hidden/unselected rows excluded. The board build and changed-file Biome checks pass. The full worker suite has 821 passing tests, one skip, and the same 52 baseline failures with no changed failing test names.

Edge verification now succeeds, superseding the previous visual-verification limitation: the updated compact layout was inspected, Shift-click selected three rows without expanding them and disabled Follow, button and keyboard copying produced identical full text including paired results, filtered Select All selected only visible rows, and changing filters cleared selection. The page had no horizontal overflow or browser console errors. The user's clipboard was cleared back to its original empty state after verification. Only static assets were updated locally; no agent restart was needed. User log content and screenshots are not included in the repository.

## Drag selection and alignment follow-up

Mouse dragging now draws a selection rectangle over activity rows. Ctrl/Cmd or Shift adds to the current selection; dragging near the list edges scrolls it. Expanded details retain native text selection. Drag completion focuses the list for direct keyboard copying and suppresses the click that would otherwise expand a row.

The toolbar, timeline and row checkboxes now share a responsive gutter. Rows without issue identifiers retain the issue column in the all-task view, and expanded details align with the message column.

Edge checks verified downward and upward rectangle selection of four rows, with no accidental expansion or remaining selection overlay. Ctrl+C immediately after dragging copied four entry headers; an ordinary click still expanded and collapsed details. The clipboard was restored after verification. DOM measurements at a 1912px viewport confirmed the source filter, select-all checkbox, row checkboxes and timeline labels at the same x-coordinate; all message previews and expanded detail text also shared their respective x-coordinate. There was no horizontal overflow or browser console error. Edge autoscrolling is implemented but was not separately exercised in the browser.

The board build and changed-file Biome checks pass. Rectangle intersection and additive selection tests pass alongside selection, activity and raw-viewer regression tests (10 total). The full worker suite has 822 passing tests, one skip and the same 52 failing test names as the Windows baseline. Local deployment replaced only the bundled static assets without restarting the agent.

## Compact toolbar follow-up

Removed the breadcrumb and separate service/filter bars. One toolbar now contains the view switch, search, selection actions when needed, and a Log options disclosure. Source/error filters, wrapping, Follow, pause, refresh, task details and loaded-window statistics live in the disclosure. The service state is available from the status dot beside Tasks. Vanilla frontend state and React controls communicate through callbacks instead of reading controls by DOM ID.

Edge verification measured a 48px toolbar at the normal 1912px viewport and at 600px with a selected log row. All toolbar controls fit without horizontal overflow. Source and error filtering, pause/resume through refresh, and switching to Raw worked; the options panel closed on an outside click. The page reported no console errors and the viewport override was reset afterward. No breadcrumb or separate filter bar remains. HTML, JavaScript and CSS were deployed locally without restarting Atmiko.

The board build, changed-file Biome checks and 10 activity/selection/viewer regressions pass. The full worker suite remains at 822 passing tests, one skip and the same 52 Windows failures, with no changed failing test names. No backend or dependency changes were needed.

## Disclosure icon follow-up

Replaced the font-dependent disclosure characters with Hugeicons `ArrowRight01Icon`, rendered through the official React package at 14px. Expanded rows rotate the SVG 90 degrees around its center. Detail offsets account for the wider icon at every breakpoint. Both Hugeicons packages are pinned build dependencies and their MIT notices are included in the served JavaScript license file; the icon needs no CDN request.

Edge measured zero vertical center offset for all 140 rendered arrows and for the expanded arrow. The expanded detail text still aligned with its row's message column. Visual inspection confirmed the right/down arrows; the page had no console errors. The board build, worker typecheck and changed-file Biome checks pass. The full worker suite has 822 passes, one skip and the same 52 baseline failing test names. Local deployment updated only static assets and license text.

## Escape selection follow-up

Esc clears activity row selection, the Shift-selection anchor and copy feedback using the same action as the Clear button. It also cancels an in-progress marquee, stops its animation frame and ignores subsequent drag movement until pointer release. IME composition is excluded; an Esc handled for row selection preserves search text and still allows the options panel to close.

In Edge, selecting all 140 rows followed by Esc cleared every row, reset the select-all checkbox and removed the copy actions. Esc from the search field cleared a filtered selection while preserving its query. A single-row selection with the options panel open was also cleared, and the panel closed. No console errors were recorded. In-progress marquee cancellation was reviewed in code rather than separately exercised in the browser.

The board build and changed-file Biome checks pass. The complete worker suite remains at 822 passes, one skip and the same 52 baseline failing test names. Only the local JavaScript asset was replaced; Atmiko was not restarted.

## Full-row highlighting follow-up

Hover, expanded and selected backgrounds now belong to the complete activity heading, including its checkbox and left gutter. The summary button is transparent so the row has one continuous background in every state.

Edge mouse movement over the checkbox and summary produced the same `rgb(248, 248, 250)` heading background. Expanded and selected states covered the same region, with the button remaining transparent. Expanding, selecting, clearing with Esc and collapsing still worked; the console had no errors. The board build and CSS Biome check pass. This CSS-only change was checked in the browser without adding redundant unit tests; only the local CSS asset was replaced.

## Jump to bottom follow-up

Both Activity and Raw provide a floating Hugeicons down-arrow button when the log viewport is more than two pixels above its bottom. Clicking it jumps to the latest output and enables Follow, using the same search-reset behavior as the existing Follow control. Task, source/error filters and pause state are retained. Activity also rechecks its position after content, expansion, wrapping and viewport-size changes; Raw uses the log viewer's scroll callback.

The board build, changed-file Biome checks and 10 existing activity/selection/viewer regressions pass. Local static assets were updated without restarting Atmiko, and `/status` still returns HTTP 200. Browser interaction verification could not be completed in this follow-up: the existing Edge tab's debugger connection timed out, and opening a fresh local-board tab was blocked by the browser. No successful click or visual verification is claimed for this button.

## Linear issue shortcut follow-up

Task cards provide an always-visible Hugeicons external-link arrow beside Linear-style issue identifiers, including archived tasks. Links use Linear's documented `/issue/ENG-123` route with an encoded identifier and open a new tab with `noopener noreferrer`. Chat tasks without a matching identifier do not display a link. Card selection and issue navigation are separate sibling controls, avoiding nested interactive elements and preserving the selected log view when following a link.

Edge verification confirmed links on active and archived cards, visible 16px SVG icons, correct link attributes, no nested buttons and no horizontal overflow. Selecting an archived task still displayed its logs. Clicking its arrow opened a new tab that resolved to the corresponding workspace issue and matching heading; the original task selection remained unchanged. No browser console errors were reported. User issue details and screenshots are not included in the repository.

The board build, changed-file Biome checks and 10 existing activity/selection/viewer regressions pass. The full worker suite has 822 passes, one skip and exactly the same 52 failing names as the Windows baseline. Only static assets were deployed locally; the running worker was not restarted.

## Task model label follow-up

Task cards display the recorded model beside repository metadata; missing values explicitly show `Model unknown`. Model changes are included in the task rendering signature so live snapshots update the label even when other task metadata stays unchanged. The full model is also included in the card tooltip.

Edge verified both a populated model label and the unknown-model fallback alongside the issue shortcuts. Live activity continued rendering, with no page overflow or console errors. The board build and changed-file Biome checks pass. The complete worker suite remains at 822 passes, one skip and the same 52 baseline failing names. Static assets were updated without restarting the worker.
